## Idea

The Idea for my project is to create a handheld console to play basic games on. For game ideas the plan is to recreate Pong and then continue if the time permits. The general shape and feel for the device is loosely based on the original Gameboy

The shell of the device will be made out of either PETG or ABS to ensure no problems with warping due to temperature created by the internals. For said internals, the plan is to use a custom build Arduino-Uno. The device is supposed to contain a small LCD-Screen. For controls I intend to use a set of Cherry MX-Style mechanical switches. Due to the size of these switches they will have to be incorporated into the shell of the device.

To power the device, the inital plan is to use an external 5V Powersupply for testing. Time permitting, the plan is to include a battery and charging circuitry into the device. For this either a LiPo battery or a set 18650 Cells could be used.

## Potential Problems
This project obviously consists of a multitude of different parts that have to work together to combine into the final idea. One of the biggest sources of potential problems could be the electrical internals. Custom building an Arduino Uni could pose some problems that might not be fully plannable for. 

Besides this, the planning for the shell needs to take into account not just the physical parts, but all other small bits that might be needed for final project. As such during planning of the design, sufficient space for all wiring, the battery and the charging circuitry needs to be taken into account. The selected Keyswitches also need to be taken into account during the design phase, as they will be integrated into the shell of the device.
